        <p> java development is the process of creating software applications using the Java programming language.
        Java is widely used because it is secure, reliable, and platform independent, which means Java programs
        can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is commonly used to build web
        applications, mobile apps, desktop software, and enterprise-level systems.</p>
